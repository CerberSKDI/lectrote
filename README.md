# Lectrote
## The [Quixe][]/GlkOte IF interpreter in an [Electron][] shell

[Quixe]: http://eblong.com/zarf/glulx/quixe/
[Electron]: http://electron.atom.io
[Node]: http://nodejs.org

Basically, this is a way to package up the Chromium browser and the Quixe IF interpreter as a Mac/Win/Linux app.

This version acts as a general Glulx interpreter. When launched, it prompts you to select a Glulx game file (`.ulx` or `.gblorb`) to play. You can play several games at the same time in separate windows.

Because this relies on the Quixe interpreter, sound is not supported. It's also not as fast as a native interpreter.

## For developers

If you've just downloaded the source code for this puppy, it's easy to make a runnable version.

First, you need to have the [Node][] development tools installed. Everything relies on the `npm` command-line tool. See [Installing Node.js via package manager][npminstall].

[npminstall]: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

To fetch all the necessary Node packages and place them in a `node_modules` directory:

    npm install

You must also fetch the Quixe engine (which will live in the `quixe` directory):

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Now just type

    npm start

...to launch the app.

When run this way, the app will show up named as "Electron", not "Lectrote".
