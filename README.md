## The [Quixe][]/GlkOte IF interpreter in an [Electron][] shell

[Quixe]: http://eblong.com/zarf/glulx/quixe/
[Electron]: http://electron.atom.io

Basically, this is a way to package up the Chromium browser and the Quixe IF interpreter as a Mac/Win/Linux app.

This project is still in the proof-of-concept stage. Large chunks don't work yet.
